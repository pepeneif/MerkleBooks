# Project Brief: SolBooks (Merkle.Space)

## Core Mission
SolBooks is a professional Solana accounting software (branded as Merkle.Space) designed to solve the critical shortcomings of existing Solana wallets (like Phantom) where users cannot add labels or notes to remember what each transaction was made for.

## Branding Strategy
- **Internal Project Code**: SolBooks
- **Public Domain/Brand**: Merkle.Space
- **UI Display**: Shows "Merkle.Space" branding in user interface

## Problem Statement
Current Solana wallets provide transaction history but lack:
- Transaction labeling and categorization
- Income/expense classification
- Notes and context for each transaction
- Comprehensive accounting features for crypto finance management
- Multi-wallet transaction aggregation and monitoring

## Solution
A beautiful, production-ready accounting application built specifically for Solana blockchain transactions that enables users to:
- Track and classify transactions across multiple wallets
- Add custom labels, notes, and categories to transactions
- Generate professional invoices and manage payments
- Export/import data for backup and tax reporting
- Monitor balances and transactions in real-time

## Key Differentiators
- **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally, no external servers
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Monitor multiple Solana addresses simultaneously
- **Professional Design**: Apple-inspired UI with light/dark themes
- **Comprehensive Features**: Transaction classification, invoice management, data export
- **Developer-Friendly**: Open source with full TypeScript implementation
