# Current Context: SolBooks

## Current Work Focus
SolBooks is a fully functional Solana accounting application with all core features implemented and working. The project has reached a mature state with comprehensive functionality for transaction management, multi-wallet monitoring, and data export/import capabilities.

## Recent State Analysis
- **Branding**: Clarified strategy - "SolBooks" is internal project code, "Merkle.Space" is public brand (UI correctly shows Merkle.Space)
- **Core Features**: All main accounting features are complete and functional
- **Security Layer**: Comprehensive security architecture with centralized configuration and secure logging
- **External API Integration**: Jupiter API for real-time exchange rates with robust fallback mechanisms
- **Error Handling**: Advanced error boundary system with specialized boundaries for different app areas
- **Data Storage**: Robust localStorage-based data management with full export/import functionality
- **Multi-Chain Ready**: Architecture supports easy extension to other blockchains
- **Production Ready**: Application is stable and suitable for real-world use with enterprise-grade security

## Current Architecture Status
- **Frontend**: Complete React TypeScript application with modern UI/UX
- **Security Architecture**: Centralized security configuration with input validation and secure logging
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundary system with specialized boundaries and recovery mechanisms
- **External APIs**: Jupiter Price API integration with caching, rate limiting, and fallback strategies
- **Blockchain Integration**: Fully implemented Solana Web3 integration with rate limiting and security
- **State Management**: React hooks-based state management working effectively
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage-based with backup/restore capabilities and security validation
- **RPC Management**: Configurable RPC endpoints with preset and custom options

## Key Technical Highlights
- **Security-First Architecture**: Centralized security configuration with input validation and sensitive data protection
- **Secure Logging System**: Structured logging with automatic sanitization of sensitive information
- **Error Boundary Strategy**: Specialized error boundaries for different app areas with recovery mechanisms
- **Jupiter API Integration**: Real-time exchange rates with caching, rate limiting, and fallback mechanisms
- **Robust Transaction Fetching**: Handles both SOL and SPL tokens with batch processing and security validation
- **Rate Limiting Protection**: Debounced operations and request delays prevent API overload across all services
- **Multi-Token Support**: Comprehensive token list with logo support and metadata validation
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing token information and API failures
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices with accessibility considerations

## Areas for Potential Enhancement
1. **Categories System**: Currently simple implementation, could be enhanced with custom icons/colors
2. **Analytics**: Could add more sophisticated reporting and charts with security considerations
3. **Multi-Chain**: Architecture ready for Ethereum and other blockchain support with security extensions
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Transaction filtering could be more granular with performance optimization
5. **Export Formats**: Could support additional export formats (CSV, PDF reports) with security validation
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Could enhance API monitoring and performance tracking dashboard
7. **Security Auditing**: Could add security event logging and audit trail features

## Development Environment
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React TypeScript template
- **Security**: Centralized security configuration and secure logging utilities
- **External APIs**: Jupiter Price API integration with comprehensive error handling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Apple-inspired design system
- **State**: React hooks with localStorage persistence and security validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana Wallet Adapter with multi-wallet support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundary system throughout application

## Next Steps
The application is feature-complete for its core mission with enterprise-grade security and error handling. Future development should focus on:
- Enhanced user experience improvements with security considerations
- Advanced analytics and reporting features with secure data handling
- Multi-chain support expansion with security architecture extension
- Performance optimizations for large transaction sets with monitoring
- Security audit trail and compliance features
- API monitoring dashboard and performance metrics
- Advanced caching strategies for improved responsiveness
