# Current Context: SolBooks

## Current Work Focus
SolBooks is a fully functional Solana accounting application with all core features implemented and working. The project has reached a mature state with comprehensive functionality for transaction management, multi-wallet monitoring, and data export/import capabilities.

## Recent State Analysis
- **Branding**: Clarified strategy - "SolBooks" is internal project code, "Merkle.Space" is public brand (UI correctly shows Merkle.Space)
- **Core Features**: All main accounting features are complete and functional
- **Data Storage**: Robust localStorage-based data management with full export/import functionality
- **Multi-Chain Ready**: Architecture supports easy extension to other blockchains
- **Production Ready**: Application is stable and suitable for real-world use

## Current Architecture Status
- **Frontend**: Complete React TypeScript application with modern UI/UX
- **Blockchain Integration**: Fully implemented Solana Web3 integration with rate limiting
- **State Management**: React hooks-based state management working effectively
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage-based with backup/restore capabilities
- **RPC Management**: Configurable RPC endpoints with preset and custom options

## Key Technical Highlights
- **Robust Transaction Fetching**: Handles both SOL and SPL tokens with batch processing
- **Rate Limiting Protection**: Debounced operations and request delays prevent API overload
- **Multi-Token Support**: Comprehensive token list with logo support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing token information
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices

## Areas for Potential Enhancement
1. **Categories System**: Currently simple implementation, could be enhanced with custom icons/colors
2. **Analytics**: Could add more sophisticated reporting and charts
3. **Multi-Chain**: Architecture ready for Ethereum and other blockchain support
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Transaction filtering could be more granular
5. **Export Formats**: Could support additional export formats (CSV, PDF reports)

## Development Environment
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React TypeScript template
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Apple-inspired design system
- **State**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana Wallet Adapter with multi-wallet support

## Next Steps
The application is feature-complete for its core mission. Future development should focus on:
- Enhanced user experience improvements
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
- Multi-chain support expansion
- Performance optimizations for large transaction sets
